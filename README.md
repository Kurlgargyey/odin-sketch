# odin-sketch

This is an implementation of an etch-a-sketch webapp completed for the Odin Project online curriculum.

It can generate a grid based on user input (up to 100x100 cells), validating the user input and rejecting it if it's unusable.

The cells also gradually gain darkness as you mouseover multiple times, changing hue randomly each time.

I tried to get the whole thing to scale to the viewport size, but couldn't get it to stay square.
